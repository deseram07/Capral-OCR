Capral-OCR
==========
These files are for the recognition software which is to be installed into the main computer.
The input for the program is the folder name in which the images to be processed are stored in.

For the software to work, it must be ensured that Tesseract OCR is installed in the computer. 
This can be found downloaded from this website: https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/

The “pytesser.py” script must be saved in:
“C:\<Python directory>\Lib\site-packages\”

Which enables communication with the Tesseract program.
